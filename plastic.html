                Plastic-monsoonal relations are particularly
                acute in Yangon where plastic waste is
                overwhelming urban infrastructures. Throughout
                the city ‘refuse run-off’ and ‘runaway rubbish’
                results in floods every monsoon season.
                Following plastic through the city, reveals multifaceted relations between plastic, people and the
                monsoon.

                Given its ubiquity, the plastic trail has many
                potential beginnings, routes and endings. Tracing
                plastics through Yangon focused mainly on singleuse items, plastic bags, water bottles, plastic
                straws and sachets, and their entanglements
                within the monsoonal-hydrological cycle. These
                plastics are utilised, discarded and transported
                with the rains through urban waterways, into rivers
                and then oceans via the Bay of Bengal. Through
                following plastic journeys, monsoon weather
                becomes a lively and significant agent in the
                creation, discard, mobilisation and transformation
                of plastic materials. Weather-plastic relations are a
                reminder that the story of plastic is not exclusively
                human.

                than this – [plastic] materials that
                can last practically forever are

                The plastic life cycle begins with gas and oil, the
                basic building blocks of all plastics. Made from
                hydrocarbons, synthetic plastic polymers can be
                moulded, extruded or cast into films, filaments and
                fibres of all shapes and sizes. Designed to replace
                rare natural materials, plastics were intended to
                produce luxury long-lasting items. In recent times,
                however, a growing proportion of cheap plastics
                are produced, with half of global plastics going
                into single-use applications. Only nine percent of
                all plastics ever made are recycled and most is
                deposited into landfills. Plastic has become an
                everyday infrastructure, its ubiquity an indicator
                of how far capitalism has seeped into lives and
                societies across the globe.

                “This is a society of street food
                and when you get street food it’s
                almost always in a plastic bag.
                Whether you get something hot or
                fruit and vegetables, everything is
                in plastic”.³

              <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText plasticCopySeven">
                The role that plastic plays in Yangon’s street food
                culture is striking. Plastic forms the stools, tables
                and table cloths that people rest on, the cutlery,
                cups and straws that people eat and drink from,
                and the bags, string and takeaway containers used
                to transport food. Unlike traditional, biodegradable
                materials, plastic enables food to be preserved
                longer in hot, humid conditions, reducing food
                waste. This is appealing in an environment where
                spoilage of food is common during monsoon
                season. Although plastic proofs against the effects
                of a monsoonal climate, its utilization and discard is
                influenced by the seasons and shifting consumption
                patterns. Many festivals in the Burmese calendar
                occur in cool, dry winter months when monsoon
                rains have eased; as festivities intensify so does
                waste production.

                Yangon is flooded because the

                Plastic discarded on city streets finds its way into
                drains and waterways, forming blockages that
                prevent rainwater from moving through the city.
                Monsoon waters flood streets and low-lying areas
                as plastics disrupt hydraulic infrastructures. While a
                large amount of plastic waste is thrown onto streets,
                back alleys and waterways, the majority of plastic
                waste is transported to municipal dumpsites. Vast
                open mounds of entangled plastic are baked in the
                sun during the dry season and drenched by monsoon
                rain during the wet season, gradually disintegrating
                over time. Because Yangon’s dumpsites are not
                ‘sanitary’, meaning they are not segregated from
                their geo-hydrological surroundings via lining
                materials, plastics leak into soil and water, with
                flooding, storms and monsoon runoff enabling their
                transportation.

                Although plastic accumulates within urban
                landscapes, it does not remain confined to cities,
                but travels far beyond urban boundaries, mobilised
                by the fluxes of the weather-world. With the flushing
                effect of monsoon rains, plastics makes their way
                from urban streets, waterways and dumpsites
                into the surrounding rivers. Plastic transport
                rates increase with precipitation as accumulated
                plastics are mobilised and washed downstream.
                Once entering the ocean, plastics move with ocean
                currents, waves and wind, accumulating in garbage
                patches. Although the Indian Ocean receives
                the largest input of plastics globally, rather than
                forming patches, the ocean’s unique monsoonal
                rhythms, currents and atmospheric circulations
                disperse plastics through vast oceanic pathways.
                While oceans may appear to be the final sink for
                plastics, they do not remain confined here either,
                they return via beached pollutants, plastic rain and
                contaminants in the food chain.

                to maintain separations and barriers between
                bodies, things and the environment, it persistently
                breaks these divisions through fragmentation,
                accumulation and dispersal. As plastics infiltrate
                earth systems through the hydrological, geological
                and meteorological cycles, they gradually become
                entangled within ecological webs. Far from being
                benign and inactive, plastics actively transform and
                are transformed by these intra-actions, producing
                novel ecologies and mutant geologies that will be
                part of earth systems for millennia to come. With
                this understanding, we must relinquish the idea that
                plastic is separate from the more-than-human world
                in which it is produced. Whether we like it or not,
                plastics are inextricably bound up in our present and
                future becomings.
