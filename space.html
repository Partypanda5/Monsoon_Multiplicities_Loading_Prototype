                Spatial practice, regardless of practitioner, operates
                on one central claim: space is to be arranged and
                occupied by one in order to exclude the Other.
                Accordingly, no two bodies – human, nonhuman,
                technological, immaterial, material, elemental, or
                systemic – may occupy the same space at the same
                time. However, when the materiality of air is taken
                into consideration, all bodies must recognise and
                become enlivened by their intimacy with Others. The
                immersion of beings within the meteorological world
                does not dissolve one into another, but emphasises
                their need to co-evolve, empowering the distinctive
                differences of each to forge new identities, self
                and collective. In an attempt to define a spatial
                practice <em>with</em> the monsoon, the spatial practices <em>of</em> the monsoon were revealed, highlighting a need to
                redefine the <em>self</em>.

                the monsoon embeds itself within human materiality
                and affect, creating identities and agencies of
                difference. Manifest differently across bodies,
                these differences, or identities, compose a transcorporeal being that transforms and is transformed
                by the dynamic material world of each encounter.

                lived environments of coexisting bodies, elements,
                and material relations, a forceful spatial practice.
                Hastened by a destabilised climate, the twin

                The monsoon’s spatial practices are relational
                across time and space. The monsoonal environment
                consists of a world of enlivened flesh, from
                dragonflies and mangoes to salt farmers and urban
                residents, whose needs, claims, and actions are
                determined by their elemental entanglement within
                the monsoon’s meteorological milieu. Unpredictable
                and unreliable, the monsoon constructs a meshwork
                of fragile bodies whose existence relies on the
                necessary and contingent relations between them.
                For design practitioners, the monsoonal site must
                be understood as a meshwork of shifting gradients
                of meteorological saturation, a kinetic site that
                requires designers to consider the many exchanges
                between and across bodies as a collaborating
                partner of spatial practice. Premised on the idea
                of material and relational control, both historical
                and contemporaneous spatial frameworks used to
                distribute infrastructures and resources neglect to
                consider the monsoon as co-creative of intra-active
                co-constituencies.

                Reliant on the monsoon’s construction of time,
                space, and resource, residents of monsoonal lifeworlds require designers to pay attention to the
                interactions between weather, bodies, and places.
                However, climate models used by designers use
                methods of collection and calibration that do not
                account for the fluxes of local weather-in-action. For
                spatial practice, weathering, a practice of evolving
                with Others, prioritises the present-tense of weatherin-action. Registrations of weather-in-action, on both
                immediate and long-term timescales, represent
                the design of space by the weather-world itself.
                In order to pay attention to shifting vulnerabilities
                and volatilities, model apertures need to be tuned
                towards highlighting, not occluding, these spacetimes of intra-activity.

                Monsoonal South Asia is home to a diverse
                landscape of cities. As they evolve or weather, the
                multivariant configurations of bodies, materials,
                and elements form and reform into pluralistic sets
                of identities whose struggle to coexist challenges
                political and spatial policy. The pervasiveness
                of the monsoon blurs the boundaries between
                meteorological and social phenomenon.
                When seasonal relationships are constructed
                inconsistently, material precarities induce spatial
                responses that often enhance differential weathering
                patterns. Chennai’s annual programme of resurfacing
                roadways during the dry season for instance has
                constructed a raised, networked accumulation of
                asphalt that distributes stormwater runoff directly
                into homes and businesses. As a result, able
                residents raise their homes and businesses above
                the road network, lifting entire buildings onto raised

                Typical urban planning practices of mapping inhibit
                a practitioner’s ability to see space in time. Of these
                practices, the statistical calculation of the ‘100-year
                floodline’ and its two-dimensional application onto
                city plans produces planning policies and master
                plans that miscalculate the dynamic relationships
                between weather and urban materiality. The
                abstraction of weather dynamics into climatic
                statistics leads to ineffective zoning regulations.
                Constructing cities through the amalgamated
                production of uneven and shifting distributions of
                risk over time, weather must be understood as a
                socio-spatial convergence. Urban planners attempt
                to approximate the material realisation of weather
                across terrain, but often fail to consider rain as a part
                of the material world <em>before</em> it enters the surficial
                flows and inundated grounds on the earth’s surface.
                To see space in time requires us to account for

                Through its ability to implode and expand in Cities,
                assemblages of processual relations, are continually
                made and remade by the many beings, forces, and
                materials that live within, surround, and pass through
                them. For the spatial disciplines and environmental
                humanities to learn from the monsoon, cities
                must not be seen as measurable and bounded
                products of political design and technologies;
                rather, they must find comfort and agility in dealing
                with ungrounded and unsettled sites of material
                and immaterial coherence. As a nonhuman agent
                of spatial practice, the monsoon’s vibrant and
                provocative materialisation of a weather-world-in-flux
                asks us to form a new set of ethics and modes of
                response that allow us to engage with, not attempt
                to dominate, its evolution.an atmosphere’s geometry
                claims vitality. The meteorological intensity of the
                monsoon demands that the atmosphere be seen
                not as background, but as a performer in the coconstruction of the ever-engulfing ‘out-there’ that
                is fuelled by the affective and material instabilities
                required to balance an ever-dynamic earth.
