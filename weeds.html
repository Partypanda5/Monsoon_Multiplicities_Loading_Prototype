                Decay is a building process; it has a chemical slant
                and a differential dynamic distribution. The process
                of decay builds new states of extensity, affect,
                magnitude and even integrity from and out of a system
                or formation without nullifying or reforming it. The
                decaying formation is disposed of its chances to die
                or to live wholesomely, to be abolished, reformed
                or delivered to its origin. For this reason, decay is
                an irresolute process of building that potentiates
                architectures which, while infinitely open to new
                syntheses and transformations, cannot undergo
                complete annulment or return to their original form.<sup>1</sup>

                Yangon has one of the largest remaining collections
                of colonial buildings in the world. Most were built in
                the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to
                house the governors, administrators, entrepreneurs
                and financiers of British Burma. The buildings
                were constructed of brick or stone, conveying the
                impression that “London had been transplanted
                into a tropical landscape” and establishing colonial
                authority as permanent and solid.<sup>2</sup>

              After Burma’s independence in 1948, the colonial
              building stock was nationalised and used by the
              military or occupied by Burmese citizens. Neglect,
              lack of maintenance and exposure to the tropical
              climate and annual monsoon rains saw decay set
              in, enabling the chemical mineralogy of bricks and
              mortar to interact with the liveliness of the monsoon
              and life to thrive on and beneath their surface.

            Decay was augmented by birds, rats and other
            species who inadvertently dispersed seeds adaptive
            to limestone-rich alkaline mortars. Mosses appeared,
            staining brickwork green. Delicate flora began to
            sprout from ledges, window sills and cracks. Roots
            and tendrils clung to facades and up pilasters.
            Exuberant plant growth followed moisture saturated
            bricks up broken downpipes. Aerial ficus roots
            entwined themselves around waterlogged columns.
            Shrubs protruded from canopies and rooflines. Over
            time relatively stable plant associations that defied
            the botanical order of the city took hold.

            After Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for
            Democracy won its first parliamentary seat in 2012,
            western sanctions against Myanmar were lifted
            and foreign investment poured into the country. The
            colonial buildings of downtown Yangon suddenly
            faced a new threat, not from chemical reactions
            and plant growth, but from the return of capitalism
            and the pressures of development. This resulted
            in the establishment of the Yangon Heritage Trust
            to promote heritage-led planning and building
            conservation as a central tenet in the cultural and
            economic reimagining of the city.

            As Yangon’s colonial buildings are reimagined and
            reclaimed, the first victims are the weeds growing
            on their surfaces. Buildings are sealed, made whole
            again and imagined separations of nature from
            culture are reasserted. But while these interventions
            might hold off the processes of weathering and
            decay for as long as their benefactors care to sustain
            them, the monsoon will eventually prevail. Cracks,
            efflorescence and weeds will return, commemorating
            what could have lasted, or was about to happen,
            but did not. Their unyielding persistence will be a
            potent reminder that buildings are composed of and
            radically open to what surrounds them - air, moisture,
            carbon, salts, chemicals, birds, insects and plants,
            that cohere for only brief moments, and always
            provisionally, into social projects.
