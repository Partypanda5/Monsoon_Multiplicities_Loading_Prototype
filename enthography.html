                  Throughout the project we have used ethnographic
                  methods to engage with the monsoon as an earth
                  system vastly distributed in time and space, whilst
                  exploring the many ways in which monsoonal
                  weather becomes entangled within urban
                  environments. While ethnographic ways of working
                  with meteorological phenomena are still emerging,
                  finding ways to attune to the agentive capacities of
                  weather is vital in light of uncertain futures.

                      Embarking on the first phase of fieldwork we had
                      a very limited sense of how the monsoon was
                      conceptualised and understood by people residing
                      in the three cities. Initial attempts to explore people’s
                      weather-worlds involved talking with meteorologists,
                      academics, environmental activists, architects,
                      planners, and urban dwellers from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Initial conversations
                      about the monsoon in Chennai encompassed
                      the traditional Tamil calendar, meteorological
                      seasons and changing meteorological terminology,
                      the personalities and characteristics of different
                      monsoonal phases and suggestions that
                      monsoon might be a colonial concept. These
                      conversations revealed the diversity of human
                      attempts to comprehend and make sense of this
                      complex meteorological phenomenon and their
                      entanglements over time.

                          Monsoon Assemblages was framed politically
                          with an explicit focus on the influence of human
                          activities, particularly rapid urban growth, on
                          monsoon climates. Fieldwork in each city drew us
                          to particular sites of urban expansion, revealing
                          landscapes of accumulation and the geopolitical and
                          macro economic dynamics driving urban growth.
                          Work on water infrastructures and processes of
                          encroachment made us aware of the inequities and
                          power dynamics at play within urban landscapes.
                          Monsoonal materials drew attention to insatiable
                          urban appetites for soil, sediment and water and the
                          role that cities play in driving extractive processes.
                          Following monsoonal species we sensed the impact
                          that rapidly expanding built environments are having
                          on nonhuman worlds. Throughout the research it
                          was clear that monsoon weather is political.

                          Intuiting a monsoonal ethnography has been an
                          emergent process. In the course of following
                          monsoonal lines of flight, we have woven together
                          fragments to form a partial and incomplete
                          patchwork. The journey has been personal,
                          transformational and contingent, responsive to
                          the excesses, complexities and entanglements of
                          monsoonal life-worlds. The monsoon has played
                          an active role throughout, shaping and informing
                          the process. Following the monsoon has opened
                          avenues we may not otherwise have explored,
                          forged connections between things we may have
                          considered in isolation, and expanded our fields of
                          perception beyond grounded happenings to include
                          atmospheric concerns.
