                    From its earliest beginnings brickmaking has
                    been bound up with the weather. By regulating the
                    microclimates of human habitation, bricks mediate
                    relations with weather and climate. As well as
                    being reactive to weather, bricks are entangled
                    with weather through their production. Historically,
                    brickmaking was a seasonal activity due to its
                    reliance on the heat of the sun. Relations between
                    weather and brickmaking are still apparent in the
                    monsoonal terrain of Bangladesh. During the wet
                    season frequent rain, high humidity and reduced
                    sunlight impede the drying and firing of bricks.
                    Due to these monsoonal fluctuations, brick fields
                    only operate during drier months, the season of
                    production determined by the monsoon.

                    Brick fields are immediately apparent on visiting
                    Dhaka, they proliferate along river banks surrounding
                    the city, their towering chimneys emerging from the
                    low-lying riverine terrain. Bricks form a ubiquitous,
                    ever-present part of the urban landscape; their
                    visibility and mobility an indicator of rampant
                    urbanisation. Brick making in Bangladesh has grown
                    exponentially to supply the booming infrastructure
                    and construction industry. Although brick kilns
                    are prevalent throughout Bangladesh they have
                    mushroomed around Dhaka, one of the world’s
                    largest cities. The continued growth of the city is
                    contingent on the expansion of the brick industry
                    with consequences for humans and nonhumans
                    alike.

                    Bangladesh bricks are reliant on clay-rich soils
                    extracted from the alluvial floodplains of the delta.
                    Clay, the essential element for bricks, is almost
                    always formed through weathering; emerging from
                    erosive movements of wind, water and rain. The
                    Bengal delta is formed from alluvial materials, mostly
                    derived from the Himalayas. Through weathering,
                    sedimentary rocks are transported and deposited
                    by seasonal monsoonal flows, forming the clay-rich
                    soils that become <em>Bangla</em> bricks. The brick sector
                    in Bangladesh consumes an estimated forty-five
                    million tons of clay every year, as farmers sell their
                    clay-rich top soil to the brick kilns. Due to the speed
                    of urbanisation, removal of topsoil for brickmaking
                    is occurring at a rate that cannot compete with
                    geological cycles.

                    Brick making operates around a monsoonal cycle,
                    beginning in November and ending in April before
                    the first monsoon rains arrive. Brick kilns churn
                    relentlessly in the dry season, dependent on the
                    labour of seasonal migrants. Plumes of black smoke,
                    blankets of thick smog and clouds of brick dust flux
                    with the seasons, emissions peaking in December
                    and January. Dhaka has some of the most polluted
                    air in the world, with brickfields responsible for up
                    to forty percent of ambient PM 2.5 pollution. These
                    tiny airborne particles cause respiratory conditions,
                    hinder plant growth, pollute soils and erode building
                    surfaces. Pollutants also become entangled with
                    regional atmospheric circulations, contributing to
                    changing monsoon weather patterns.

                    After firing, bricks are classified and allocated
                    for use in buildings and infrastructure. A large
                    proportion are over fired so are broken into small
                    pieces called pickets. Crushed bricks form a base
                    layer for nearly all paved roads in Bangladesh. Roads
                    are typically constructed on top of embankments to
                    raise them above wet season flood levels. Although
                    roads create new geographies and lines of relation,
                    they also obstruct flows of water and sediment
                    by imposing inflexible linear forms into a fluid
                    landscape. Bangladesh roads deteriorate during
                    the rainy season, pummelled by traffic, wind and
                    rain. Through weathering and disintegration brick
                    returns to sediment, creating seasonal cycles of
                    maintenance, fuelling the never-ending demand for
                    brick.

                    Following the materiality of the brick reveals the
                    multiple ways in which the monsoon is enmeshed
                    within lived environments in Bangladesh. Bricks
                    come into being not through human agency alone,
                    but through entanglements of geology, weather
                    and human energies. Weather contributes to
                    the emergence of bricks, their production, use,
                    and dissolution. Far from being a disconnected
                    backdrop to social life, meteorological forces are coconstitutive of social worlds, moving through them
                    and the materials that compose them.
