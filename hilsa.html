              Hilsa, the national fish of Bangladesh, is entangled with processes of urbanization and industrialization. Construction of dams, barrages, roads, bridges, ports, factories and energy infrastructures impact delta waterworlds. Such anthropogenic activities alter water and sediment flows, intensify nutrient and  pollution loads, and disrupt underwater environments. Hilsa are responding in unforeseen and unpredictable ways.

                      Known as ilish in Bengali, hilsa are a monsoonal
                      species. They inhabit the entire coastline of the Indian
                      Ocean, but they are most abundant in the upper
                      reaches of the Bay of Bengal. At the apex of the Bay
                      immense monsoonal flows merge with ocean currents
                      and tides creating a unique ecosystem. While hilsa
                      spend most of their life in the Bay they migrate to the
                      rivers of the delta to breed. The rains of the south‐west
                      monsoon act as an ecological trigger, initiating their
                      spawning migration. Hilsa used to migrate to the upper
                      reaches of all the major rivers, but in recent times their
                      range has dramatically reduced. The altered mobilities
                      of the hilsa are an indicator of shifting human-nonhuman relations

                Fishers from the Meghna River ascribe changing hilsa
                migration patterns to the inhospitable river environment.
                The Farakka Barrage, commissioned in 1975 by the
                Indian government, transformed Bangladesh’s rivers.
                The barrage reduced the velocity of monsoonal flows
                leading to siltation and sedimentation downstream,
                restricting hilsa movements. Fishers are also concerned
                by illegal sand mining, fuelled by Dhaka’s booming
                construction industry. Flotillas of sand dredgers vacuum
                gravel and sand from the river, altering its bathymetry
                and disturbing fish migration routes. In response to
                changing hilsa movements, fishers are forced deeper
                into the turbulent Bay of Bengal.

          In recent decades, rapid urbanization and the increased purchasing power of the urban middle class has led to greater fish consumption. Increased demand for the “queen of fish” resulted in unsustainable fishing practices with hilsa numbers declining from the 1970s onwards, reaching record lows in the early 2000s. Alarmed by diminishing numbers and changes to migration patterns, scientists mobilised to conserve the species. To curb unsustainable fishing, and regulate supply to urban markets, scientists developed annual ban periods to “save mother hilsa”.

        Hilsa is cooked in a myriad of ways, but knowing how to buy hilsa is an essential part of the cooking process. Not all hilsa are the same, river hilsa are tastier than marine hilsa. The fish gain fat and protein and take on the taste of the river as they move upstream; the further they travel the tastier they become. As their taste peaks at the height of the rains, for many, hilsa is the taste of monsoon season. Their taste varies from river to river. Hilsa from the river Padma, are thought to be the tastiest due to the characteristics of the river water. However, the taste of hilsa is changing. Infrastructural interventions alter river ecologies, affecting the taste, smell and texture of fish, which is sensed by those who consume them.

        Hilsa can no longer be found in the Buriganga River, one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Its waters are a glossy blue-black, covered with rampant islands of water hyacinth which feed on contaminants. The river carries an all-pervasive stench from effluents spewed from tanneries, garment factories, cement plants and fertiliser manufacturers along its banks. The flushing effects of the monsoon carries pollutants downstream, affecting fish and people who depend on them. Environmental activists believe pollution is changing hilsa movements. Hilsa have a highly developed olfactory organ, making them sensitive to smell and taste. Pollutants may impact their olfactory memory and influence migration routes.
