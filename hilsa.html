              Hilsa, the national fish of Bangladesh, is
              entangled with processes of urbanisation and
              industrialisation. Construction of dams, barrages,
              roads, bridges, ports, factories and energy
              infrastructures impact delta water-worlds. Such
              anthropogenic activities alter water and sediment
              flows, intensify nutrient and pollution loads,
              and disrupt underwater environments. Hilsa are
              responding in unforeseen and unpredictable ways.

          </h1>

          <p class="copyText fishCopyTextTwo">
            Known as <em>ilish</em> in Bengali, hilsa are a monsoonal
            species. They inhabit the Indian Ocean coastline, but
            are most abundant in the upper reaches of the Bay of
            Bengal. At the apex of the Bay immense monsoonal
            flows merge with ocean currents and tides creating
            a unique ecosystem. Hilsa spend most of their life in
            the Bay and migrate to the rivers of the delta to breed.
            The rains of the southwest monsoon initiate their
            spawning migration. Hilsa used to migrate to the upper
            reaches of all major rivers, but recently their range has
            dramatically reduced. Altered hilsa mobilities are an
            indicator of shifting human-nonhuman relations.

            estuaries of the Ganges, and in the
            rainy season ascends the larger
            rivers to spawn. I have seen it
            as high as Agra and Kanpur, but
            … about Calcutta and Dhaka it

          Fishers from the Meghna River ascribe changing
          hilsa migration patterns to the inhospitable river
          environment. The Farakka Barrage, commissioned
          in 1975 by the Indian government, transformed
          Bangladesh’s rivers. The barrage reduced the velocity of
          monsoonal flows leading to siltation and sedimentation
          downstream, restricting hilsa movements. Fishers
          are also concerned by illegal sand mining, fuelled by
          Dhaka’s booming construction industry. Flotillas of
          sand dredgers vacuum gravel and sand from the river,
          altering its bathymetry and disturbing fish migration
          routes. In response to changing hilsa movements,
          fishers are forced deeper into the turbulent Bay of
          Bengal.

        In recent decades, rapid urbanisation and the
        increased purchasing power of the urban middle
        class has led to greater fish consumption. Increased
        demand for hilsa, the ‘queen of fish’ resulted in
        unsustainable fishing practices and hilsa numbers
        declined from the 1970s onwards, reaching record
        lows in the early 2000s. Alarmed by the diminishing
        numbers, scientists mobilised to conserve the species.
        To curb unsustainable fishing, regulate supply to urban
        markets and ‘save mother hilsa’, scientists developed
        annual pre- and post-monsoon fishing bans timed to
        the seasonal movement of the fish. These initiatives
        have increased hilsa numbers, but much about the fish
        remains a mystery.

      Hilsa is cooked in a myriad of ways but knowing
      how to buy hilsa is an essential part of the
      cooking process. Not all hilsa are the same,
      river hilsa are tastier than marine hilsa because
      their bodies change as they move upstream.
      Hilsa from the Padma River are particularly
      cherished for their flavour, which is attributed to
      the qualities of the river water. As their flavour
      peaks at the height of the rains, for many, hilsa
      is the taste of monsoon season. However, as
      infrastructural interventions alter river ecologies,
      the taste, smell and texture of the fish is
      changing, and is sensed by those who consume
      them.

    Hilsa can no longer be found in the Buriganga River,
    one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Its waters
    are a glossy blue-black, covered with rampant islands
    of water hyacinth which feed on contaminants. The
    river carries an all-pervasive stench from effluents
    spewed from tanneries, garment factories, cement
    plants and fertiliser manufacturers along its banks.
    The flushing effects of the monsoon carries pollutants
    downstream, affecting fish and people who depend
    on them. Environmental activists believe pollution
    is changing hilsa movements. Hilsa have a highly
    developed olfactory organ, making them sensitive to
    smell and taste. Pollutants may impact their olfactory
