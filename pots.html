          In Yangon, the monsoon is transmuted into
          drinking water through two very different, though
          interrelated material systems. The first is the city’s
          piped water supply system, first laid by the British in
          1879, the second is the practice known as <em>Ye Gyan
          Zin</em> or water charity, practiced in Myanmar since the
          Bagan Period (1044-1298).

          Yangon’s piped water supply system can be traced
          back to the devastating El Niño droughts of 1876
          and 1877 when the aquifer feeding its shallow wells
          and tanks was insufficiently recharged, resulting
          in contamination and water shortages. As a result,
          the city’s Municipal Committee began piping water
          from Royal (Kandawgyi) Lake just north of the
          city centre to downtown neighbourhoods. Over
          the course of the next forty years, this system
          expanded into a vast infrastructural network of
          reservoirs, pipes, pumping stations and treatments
          plants extending to Gyobyu and Ngamoeyeik, nearly
          seventy miles north of the city.

          As monsoonal water is transported across

          pumps, valves, chemicals, bacteria and sand alter
          its composition. Institutions and practices that

          To this day, many sections of the city remain

          routes to citizenship can coalesce around them.
          For instance, on either side of the main water

          the eight-meter wide corridor kept open for its

          The main infrastructural element of <em>Ye Gyan Zin</em>, the
          water pot, is traditionally made in villages along the
          Ayeyarwady River in family-run potteries. A mixture of
          two types of clay is harvested from the banks of the
          river and kneaded into a paste. The pots are shaped on a
          wheel by two people working together, one pumping the
          wheel by foot, the other shaping the clay by hand. Pot
          production is traditionally timed to monsoonal rhythms,
          peaking in the month of Pyatho (late December and
          January) before the hot summer months set in, when
          water charity is most needed. The unglazed pots keep
          water cool through evaporation and those who drink
          from them describe the water as sweet with the taste of
          earth from which they were made.

          Today plastic bottles placed in coolers powered by
          generators to keep them cool are replacing traditional

          change, complaining that the flavour of water from

          facilitate lifestyles in which people take their water with
