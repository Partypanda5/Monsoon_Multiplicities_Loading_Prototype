                The monsoon’s distinctive temporality distinguishes it from other weather events. Dominant depictions of the monsoon highlight its temporal patterns, often representing ‘normal’ onset and withdrawal dates. Nevertheless, the localised behaviour of this powerful weather pattern often does not conform to such macroscale representations. Monsoon rhythms and tempos vary as weather interacts with landscapes, places, people and things.

                Monsoon rhythms create temporal structures
                for human and non-human life at macro, meso
                and micro scales. Learning to understand these

                we are to take the agencies of such processes
                seriously. During fieldwork, using an assortment
                of methods including walking, seasonal calendars,
                visual methods and sensory witnessing, we learned
                to perceive a multiplicity of monsoonal temporalities
                and temporal slippages from deep time to seasonal
                time to everyday time.

                The landscapes that Chennai, Dhaka and Yangon
                are situated within have been shaped by monsoonal
                forces over the <em>longue duree</em>. Walking these
                landscapes helped us to understand the temporal
                rhythms and material processes that formed them.
                Climbing Mount Popa, a dormant volcano in central
                Myanmar, we observed and felt patterns of erosion
                etched out by successive monsoon seasons under
                our feet. Sediments created through weathering offer
                insights into the earth systems, cycles and rhythms
                that produce monsoon time. By recording these
                rhythms, sedimentary ‘earth archives’ illuminate the
                array of nonhuman forces that shape the monsoon
                and its changing temporal patterns.

                Changing atmospheric conditions define the
                seasons that divide the year for societies across
                the globe. South Asian calendars typically divide the
                year into the hot season, the cold season and the
                rainy season, the rains being the pivot of the year.
                During fieldwork in Bangladesh we drew monsoonal
                calendars with farmers, fishers, river nomads, and
                meteorologists. The calendars charted the planting,
                transplanting and harvesting of rice; the lifecycle and
                migrations of hilsa fish; the seasonal flux of rivers
                and breeding cycles of snakes; the meteorological
                seasons and patterns of storms and cyclones.
                Making each calendar revealed a multiplicity of
                human and nonhuman monsoonal attunements.

                women each morning in the thresholds of houses,
                temples and businesses. It involves drawing on
                washed thresholds with rice flour or chalk. Patterns
                are drawn with the tips of the fingers using pinches
                of flour held between the thumb and the first finger
                and letting the powder fall in a continuous line.
                Drawing is directed by a grid of pullis or dots that are
                encircled, looped or joined using straight or curved
                lines. Kolams are transient. They are created in a
                few minutes, but after a few hours, they disappear
                as insects or birds feed on the rice flour or wind or
                people’s footsteps erase them. Processes of making
                and unmaking are repeated as daily rhythms, the
                cycle beginning again each dawn.<sup>1</sup>

                Across the Indian subcontinent monsoonal
                temporalities are changing. These meteorological
                shifts are often subtle and hard to enumerate, but
                they have significant implications for human and
                nonhuman life and the liveability of monsoonal
                cities. Short bursts of intense rain lead to flooding
                because impervious urban environments cannot
                absorb heavy rainfall over compressed timescales.
                Delayed onset and breaks in the monsoon of a week
                or more results in severe water shortages. Rising
                temperatures cause the duration of heatwaves to
                increase, amplifying urban heat island effects. Such
                changes are viscerally sensed by people enmeshed
                within monsoonal environments.

                Engaging with a kaleidoscope of interconnected
                monsoonal temporalities helped us to understand
                the diverse human and nonhuman elements that give
                rise to monsoonal rhythms and how these become
                folded within landscapes, places, people and things.
                We also sensed how changing meteorological
                temporalities are affecting lived environments.
                The ecological crisis has drawn attention to the
                temporalities of the more-than-human world.
                Responding to the effects of anthropogenic climate
                change requires attuning to an array of more-than-human times and scales and considering our
                entanglements within these temporal pulses, pauses,
                circulations, ebbs and flows with more care.

                These ‘Monsoonal Clocks’ describe

                and Myanmar. Each coloured curve
                represents one year, its distance from
                the clock centre denotes the amount
                of rainfall for that month measured in
                millimetres. They aim to demonstrate
                the different cyclical rainfall patterns and
                amounts between locations, but also the
                extreme variability and outliers within
