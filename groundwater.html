                  The Eastern Ghats is a discontinuous mountain
                  range running parallel with the coast from Odisha
                  in the north of India to the Nilgiri Hills in southern
                  Tamil Nadu. The erratic mountains separate the high
                  plateau of the Indian peninsula from the younger,
                  low-lying coastal regions. The main rivers of Tamil
                  Nadu, the Pallar, Pennai, and Kaveri, flow from the
                  plateau, forming plains of alluvial matter which drop
                  gently towards the Bay of Bengal. This landscape of
                  overlain sediments is a thick, deep, and variegated
                  groundwater medium, often saturated up to very
                  close to the surface. Below these layers of alluvium,
                  active tectonics continue to compress fractured
                  bedrock into ridges and valleys.

                  Chennai’s water system is multiple and distributed,
                  with only a fraction coming from the municipal piped
                  supply. The role of groundwater as a resource that
                  can be drawn from to meet this shortfall is deeply
                  ingrained in the urban imagination. Groundwater
                  provides a crucial means of storage, safe from
                  evaporation and surface run off, that can be used
                  to slow the outward flow of seasonal rainfall and
                  make it accessible throughout the year. Groundwater
                  abstraction occurs both within domestic plots and
                  on a commercial scale from agricultural areas
                  outside of the city. The reliance upon groundwater
                  for the region’s liveability is reflected in the statewide rainwater harvesting programme to direct
                  rainfall into the ground via percolation structures.

                  Working with groundwater requires working across
                  scales to map and corral a flowing resource,
                  which slowly descends from recharge zones in
                  the upper catchment. Hydrogeologists combine
                  field measurements taken from prototype recharge
                  structures with climatic, topographic and other data
                  in increasingly complex digital models to simulate
                  effects of climate fluctuations and engineered
                  interventions on groundwater levels. At each scale
                  groundwater exceeds the optics through which it

                  Chennai’s streets as part of the construction of
                  Chennai Metro Rail. In 2017 a massive sinkhole

                  describe significant oil deposits in groundwater
                  pumped from domestic wells, and petrochemical
                  companies register leaks via a drop in pressure in
                  their pipelines. The challenges of identifying and
                  mapping these mobile contaminant plumes as they
                  undergo attenuation processes points to the elusive
                  and fleeting nature of groundwater formations.

                  Chromepet on Chennai’s southwest fringe is named
                  after the method of tanning leather with chromium
                  sulphate, much of which was released into the
                  groundwater as effluent from tanning drums.
                  Chromium in its most common chemical form is an
                  essential nutrient to humans, but is transformed in
                  groundwater via redox reactions into a form that is
                  highly toxic. A state-mandated effluent treatment
                  plant now reduces the amount of chromium
                  transmitted into groundwater. However, groundwater
                  abstraction still surfaces historic chromium
                  deposited generations ago. Groundwater is dynamic,
                  and transformative, but it is also a slow and sticky
                  and substances remain in it for a very long time.
