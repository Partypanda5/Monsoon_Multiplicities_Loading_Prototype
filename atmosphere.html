            Atmospheres are both spatial and material in their
            meteorology and affect. Our immersion in the
            weather-world conditions both the senses and our
            engagements within and about the world around us.
            The monsoon, with its compression and expansion
            of aerial space, embeds within its inhabitants a
            pulsating rhythm of somatic responses that mark the
            delivery of meteorological material – rain, wind, and
            heat. These in turn produce spheres of economic,
            social, and political action that generate the variable
            and affective dimensions of atmospheres. Through
            the lens of the monsoon, atmospheres become a
            regenerative form of architecture co-constructed by
            the meteorological and affective conditionings of
            elemental, social, political, and financial spheres.
