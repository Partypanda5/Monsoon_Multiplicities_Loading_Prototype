                      The ocean covers seventy percent of the earth’s
                      surface, provides moisture for the atmosphere and
                      plays a key role in the production of weather and
                      climate. The circulation of heat and salt between
                      ocean basins and depths drives the intensities and
                      spatial patterns of moisture transferral from the
                      terrestrial to the atmospheric essential to the global
                      hydrological cycle. As rain erodes rock and rivers
                      carry the minerals and salts of earth’s geologic
                      history to the ocean, variable bodies of salty and
                      fresh water create dynamic volumes of sea to air
                      interaction that play an integral role in the production
                      of weather events.
