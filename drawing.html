              Drawing is not representional but constitutional for
              Monsoon Assemblages. It is a way of working out
              a new paradigm and a new imaginary for spatial
              practice. Our drawings bring the monsoon to life as
              a zone of admixture of earth sea and sky and as a
              volatile, volumetric, life-sustaining weather world. In
              the process of making them, archival maps, scientific
              data, software, photography, video, sketches and
              painting were used as cognitive tools to construct
              drawings as affective, rhetorical devices that
              describe earthly vulnerabilities at a time of climate
              change and the Anthropocene.

              One of the key questions that has guided Monsoon
              Assemblages has been how to conceive and
              grasp the monsoon through drawing. Unfurling the
              monsoon visually as a story of interdependent and
              interpenetrating natures has been one of the most
              challenging and rewarding aspects of the project.
              Our drawings were conceptualised as ways of
              thinking <em>with</em> the monsoon as an entanglement of
              intra-acting meteorological, hydrological, geological,
              biological and socio-political forces, rather than
              thinking <em>about</em> it as a scientific object, an onset date,
              an economic indicator or a disaster-in-the-making.

              This meant departing from the well settled
              analytical conventions of architectural drawing,
              namely orthographic projection and perspective
              that were not up to the task of depicting the
              voluminous, dynamic materiality of the monsoon.
              Neither were the cartographic techniques used by
              landscape architects since the 1960s that analyze
              landscapes by drawing them as separate layers of
              data. Constituting the monsoon through drawing
              required liberating drawing from the topographic
              surface in order to depict its planetary scope
              alongside local inflections, intensities, volumes,
              cycles and rhythms.

              And so, to start, we turned to the traditions of
              monsoonal cartography. The fact that the monsoon
              became a map was a distinctive feature of the
              modern age. Early monsoonal cartography, in
              keeping with the trading ambitions of European
              mercantile companies, took the form of maritime
              charts constructed on the basis of weather
              observations recorded in ships logs. When British
              involvement in India transitioned from a mercantile
              enterprise to revenue extraction, the objective of
              meteorology became the study and prediction of
              climate and synoptic charts displaced maritime
              charts as the dominant cartographic conventions. It
              is this tradition that our maps speak to.

              After a series of disastrous monsoon failures at
              the end of the nineteenth century, meteorologists
              began to realise that the monsoon must be informed
              by features occurring not just over India and its
              adjacent territories and oceans, but in other parts
              of the global land-ocean-atmosphere system.
              This introduced altitude into cartography and the
              scientific imaginary. The flight paths of kites and
              balloons began to realise the atmosphere as a
              knowable and traversable space.

              The advent of earth orbiting satellites during the
              Cold War from the 1950s onwards enabled new
              and different ways of understanding weather.
              They allowed meteorologists to literally see large
              weather systems as they developed without having
              to construct them meticulously from instrument
              readings and, with the aid of computers, to model
              past and future climates. It is this world of global
              data, parametric modeling and atmospheric politics
              that our monsoonal cartography draws from and
              speaks to.

              Our drawings begin as pixels radioed from

              data. We cull data from various open access
              platforms and sort them into columns and

              imported through the graphical parametric tool

              them into spatial data, which are coupled with

              traced from images in scientific reports. The

              software. They question the information
              provided by science by incorporating glitches
              and inconsistencies into their aesthetic. Thus
              our drawings do not represent physical reality,

              the protocols used to process them and the

              early November, a deep depression named BOB 03
              formed over the Bay of Bengal. It made landfall on
              the Tamil Nadu coast on 9 November binging heavy

              low pressure system developed, dragging clouds and
              rain over Chennai where, once trapped by the raised
              topography of the eastern Ghats, widespread flooding
