                        Monsoonal Multiplicities is an exhibition of work arising from a five-year engagement with the monsoon in India, Bangladesh, London and Myanmar by the European Research Council funded project, Monsoon Assemblages. It offers visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon by following stories of entangled beings, energies, infrastructures, life-worlds, matters, technologies and knowledge practices and their mobilisation by colonial and neo-colonial agendas. The stories are organised under five themes – <u>framings, infrastructures, interspecies interlocutors, matters and urban assemblages</u>, that serve as cuts through monsoonal encounters. The website has been designed to enable visitors to navigate rhizomatically through the stories and themes – to scroll down, leap across, return, zoom in, pause, or in other ways interact with their content without ever having to return to a home page. Navigation becomes a way of constructing circulations and cross-cutting relations, providing visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon in all its multiplicity.

                      In March 2021 Monsoon Assemblages will host a programme of online events, a walking tour and an artists’ residency in London to coincide with the launch of the exhibition. These events will open the work of Monsoon Assemblages to critical debate and invite audiences to think through its implications for spatial, ethnographic and artistic research practice at a time of ecocide, unstable weather patterns, viral toxicity and violent socio-political hegemony.

But what ever happened to it? Why is it so hidden? And what is its legacy on the ground today? The tour will convey both the ingenuity and ruthlessness of the EIC and the ways it shaped our world today.

                    Care Earth Trust is an organisation based in Chennai, India that strives to provide
                    scientific services in the area of biodiversity by assessing the human impact on
                    the environment and strategising methods to improve it. In the two decades of the
                    organization’s existence, a key focus of its work has been on evidence-based restoration
                    and management of wetlands. The integrity of wetlands is particularly important in
                    Chennai, a city composed of a network of Blue-Green environments, where hydrology 
                    plays a crucial role in urban management. In 2009, Care Earth Trust was awarded India’s

                    Forests and Climate Change, Government of India for its pioneering work on conserving

                    Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) is a wildlife conservation and habitat
                    restoration group, functioning with active projects in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore,
                    Coimbatore, Pondicherry and Tirunelveli. The group functions with volunteers and
                    focuses on involving many more citizens to join through effective public outreach
                    campaigns. EFI has worked on 130 water bodies, scientifically restoring 107 across
                    12 states in the country since its inception in 2007. Its lake and pond restoration
                    effort is a nexus in between community volunteering and scientific methods to restore
                    water bodies. Based on site conditions and experience, EFI chooses the appropriate
                    restoration techniques to complete each project. EFI began with regular peripheral
                    clean-ups around water bodies like lakes, ponds, beaches and rivers. It started with a
                    handful of volunteers but today has well over 57,000 volunteers across various cities
                    in India. Every weekend there are dedicated volunteering opportunities to clean up
                    the water bodies in various cities. This movement was further bolstered by scientific
                    collaborations with UNESCO-IHE in the Netherlands (www.un-ihe.org) who provided
                    the know-how of restoration methods used to revive water bodies globally.

                    Urban Design Collective (UDC) is a collaborative platform for architects, urban
                    designers and planners to create liveable cities. UDC’s approach is people-centric
                    and aims to bring together many stakeholders involved in the city building process as
                    equal partners to make happy, inclusive and equitable cities. We strive to engage as
                    many people as we can in our projects through immersive methods that allow them to
                    respond to complex urban challenges. Our work is constantly pushing the dimensions
                    of sustainability in our cities and goes beyond an environmental perspective to
                    also include social, cultural and economic attributes. Over the past years, we have
                    been lucky to work on initiatives that are a culmination of our drivers - the ‘Siruseri
                    Watershed Management Plan’ and ‘Big Bazaar Road, Coimbatore’ being two such
                    projects. In the former, we employed creative approaches including exploratory
                    neighbourhood walks, drawing competitions and radio talk shows to empower a local
                    community to provide input and take ownership in restoring their lake. In the latter,
                    we got the community to join us in a tactical urbanism exercise to paint the roads of
                    an arterial road trialling the expansion of the pedestrian way to make the city more
                    walkable for its people.

                    Responsible, Youth for Social Change and Reclaim Our Beaches. The Collective also
                    initiated Justice Rocks, a series of unsponsored concerts and arts collaborations that
                    resulted in ‘Chennai Poromboke Paadal,’ a music video to revalourise the Poromboke
                    Commons and the viral rap song ‘Kodaikanal Won’t’ spotlighting UK multinational
                    Unilever’s mercury pollution in the beautiful hilltown of Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu. The
                    latest youth-led group to emerge from the Collective is the Chennai Climate Action
                    Group. It describes itself as a city-based youth collective that explores, understands
                    and takes action on the impacts of development on under-represented and
                    unrepresented stakeholders such as future generations, marginalised communities
                    and biodiversity. In January 2020, CCAG facilitated the #LetChennaiBreathe Campaign
                    that saw the launch of a Tamil-English Gaana-rap video titled ‘Kaatha Vara Vidu:
                    Let Chennai Breathe’ featuring kabbadi players from North Chennai highlighting the
                    deteriorating air quality in that working class neighbourhood of Chennai.

                    Research Initiatives, Bangladesh (RIB) is a not-for-profit research organization founded
                    in 2002 by educators, social scientists and human rights activists in Bangladesh
                    to promote knowledge on poverty alleviation that is relevant, useful, innovative,
                    participatory and action-oriented. RIB views poverty as a multidimensional process
                    and recognises that the needs of poverty groups go beyond simple income generation,
                    food and shelter to areas such as equality, dignity, justice, human rights and good
                    governance. RIB supports marginalised and minority groups who are unable to
                    access basic services due to social discrimination and facilitates people’s research
                    (Gonogobeshona) in order to develop and mobilise communities. To date RIB has
                    implemented over 200 action-based research and follow-up development projects
                    among thirty-one marginalized communities, including indigenous, caste-based and
                    culturally discriminated groups. Lobbying work at both local and national levels has
                    been taken up along with and on behalf of the marginalized on various issues such
                    as land, agro-ecology, untouchability and caste, which has been effective in impacting
                    national policy-making.

                <p class="rightSideSmallerSmallerText">
                  Blue Temple is an architecture design studio based in Myanmar since 2018. It was
                  started as a reaction to the current global trend where appearance seems to be the
                  main the driver of architecture rather than societal impact. The studio undertakes
                  volunteer-based initiatives, free-of-charge design workshops, and seeks out projects
                  that contribute to social and environmental change. A key aspect of its work has been
                  advocating for the Gyobyu water supply pipeline in Yangon’s Yankin Township as a
                  green urban corridor. The studio uses a combination of computational design tools
                  with low-tech construction techniques inspired by vernacular traditions and is currently
                  experimenting with bamboo as a way of exploring new building typologies and as a
                  possible replacement for concrete and steel. One of its key projects to date has been
                  the imagination-fueled, self-directed Bamboo Playground in Yankin Township. Other
                  projects include prefabricated and modular affordable housing designs and new
                  parametrical mapping for development in Myanmar.

                  Doh Eain is a participatory design practice based in Yangon, Myanmar. In a world
                  of rapid urbanisation, we want to make sure cities are liveable, inclusive and
                  sustainable. Many in Yangon know us for our work transforming back alleyways
                  filled with trash into beautiful Alley Gardens. A current project focuses on Climate
                  Adaptation for Water Security in a Ward in Yangon’s Thaketa township. We worked
                  with the community to identify their water challenges and to generate a vision for
                  their neighbourhood. We provided practical support to the Ward Drainage Committee,
                  making immediate alterations to local drainage, and introduced local government
                  officials to retention and infiltration solutions. We implemented five rainwater
                  harvesting pilots throughout the Ward in households and community spaces. We
                  are monitoring the water use and have chosen ‘Rainwater Champions’ who provide
                  information on the value rainwater harvesting adds to resilience. By empowering local
                  communities and governments we ensure the outcomes of this project are needsbased, practical, and sustainable.

                  Myanmar is Southeast Asia’s second-largest country and its diverse landscapes
                  hold rich natural resources, from oil and gas reserves to vast gemstone and mineral
                  deposits, rivers with huge hydropower potential and some of the region’s largest
                  intact forests. Many of these resources are located in its rugged periphery, in areas
                  that have long been the stage for brutal ethnic conflict. During decades of repressive
                  military rule, exploitation of resources was largely unregulated and associated with
                  militarisation, human rights abuses and heavy social and environmental impact.
                  Resource revenues were often siphoned off by a corrupt army elite. Since a quasicivilian government took over in 2011 Myanmar has been keen to improve the sector’s
                  image to attract foreign investment. In 2014 it became a candidate country for the
                  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a voluntary global initiative which
                  obliges governments to publish natural resource revenues. The UNEARTH project
                  began in 2015 as a collaboration between six documentary photographers and the
                  Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) to provide a visual record of Myanmar’s
                  resource sector. The Unearth website is a platform for an expanding collection of
                  stories from independent photographers, filmmakers and writers shedding light on
                  extractive industries in Myanmar.

                <p class="rightSideSmallerSmallerText">
                  Thant Myanmar works to reduce the use and dependency on single-use plastics in
                  Myanmar by creating awareness of its environmental impact and supporting the use
                  of sustainable alternative materials. It all started with the chance encounter of two
                  of our founding members in March 2018, who soon found themselves in a heated
                  discussion about how their favourite places in Myanmar were disappearing under
                  mountains of plastic. They realized that they wanted to do more than complain and
                  decided to bring together people who shared the same concerns about plastic waste
                  and those who were already working on the topic. Words turned into action and the
                  response was overwhelming: plastic pollution turned out to be an issue that affected
                  everyone and that many wanted to do something about. Soon after, Thant Myanmar
                  was born as a grassroots movement tackling plastic pollution.
