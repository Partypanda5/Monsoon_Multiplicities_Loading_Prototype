                      <p class="rightSideTextMM"> Monsoonal Multiplicities is an exhibition of work arising from a five-year engagement with the monsoon in India, Bangladesh, London and Myanmar by the European Research Council funded project, Monsoon Assemblages. It offers visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon by following stories of entangled beings, energies, infrastructures, life-worlds, matters, technologies and knowledge practices and their mobilisation by colonial and neo-colonial agendas. The stories are organised under five themes – <u>framings, infrastructures, interspecies interlocutors, matters and urban assemblages</u>, that serve as cuts through monsoonal encounters. The website has been designed to enable visitors to navigate rhizomatically through the stories and themes – to scroll down, leap across, return, zoom in, pause, or in other ways interact with their content without ever having to return to a home page. Navigation becomes a way of constructing circulations and cross-cutting relations, providing visitors a virtual experience of the monsoon in all its multiplicity.

                      In March 2021 Monsoon Assemblages will host a programme of online events, a walking tour and an artists’ residency in London to coincide with the launch of the exhibition. These events will open the work of Monsoon Assemblages to critical debate and invite audiences to think through its implications for spatial, ethnographic and artistic research practice at a time of ecocide, unstable weather patterns, viral toxicity and violent socio-political hegemony

                          In this one-hour Virtual Tour, Leila Redpath will give participants a flavour of how the East India Company grew from a modest fleet of spice traders in 1600 to become the most powerful multinational corporation the world has ever known. But what ever happened to it? Why is it so hidden? And what is its legacy on the ground today? The tour will convey both the ingenuity and ruthlessness of the EIC and the ways it shaped our world today.

                <p class="rightSideEvenSmallerText">
                  The tectonic cycle is the process of continuous construction and destruction of the earth’s crust at plate boundaries, driven by the energy of the earth’s inner core. At divergent plate boundaries, new crust forms when lava cools down, while at convergent plate boundaries, one plate is subducted under another and melts back into the mantle.

                  A thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature. Most are closed glass tubes containing alcohol or mercury. Weather thermometers measure the temperature of the air.
