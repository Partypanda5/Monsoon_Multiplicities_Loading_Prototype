                The monsoon as a matter of air permeates beyond
                its seasonal temporality in enlivening what many
                of us consider as life. It grasps forms, stories,
                knowledge, entanglements and encounters in
                drenching them with atmospheric claims. Offered
                here are glimpses into sense making exercises
                during my PhD fieldwork and writing between 2017
                and 2020.

                The accompanying pictures are visual glimpses
                of a closed coal-fired power station in New Delhi.
                Alongside its distribution of fly ash and energy into
                the atmosphere, its presence signals the hum of
                industry. Although it’s now closed down, I recollect
                passing by the station on dense, rainy monsoon
                nights, and the glow above the large cooling tower
                would glimmer in eeriness. It distributed a mimetic
                viscerality: volcanoes, boiling water and the work of
                wholesale steam surrounded by the partial darkness
                of the highway. Fly ash conspiracies are both
                atmospheric and terrifying.

                The aerosol haze one experiences in places like Delhi
                plays a broad role in disturbing monsoonal rhythms.
                Aerosols increase the complexity of meteorological
                and atmospheric modelling, play a key role in
                influencing the way the monsoon is experienced and
                change monsoonal futures. Contemporary urban
                political discourse privileges the haze as a human
                health hazard. The haze as a material story however
                takes us to a broader set of implications and
                speculative futures that do not just destabilise the
                atmosphere for breathing life-forms but conspire the
                weird and eerie collapse of seasonal thermodynamic
                systems. While being situated within it as a breather
                in pain, the haze is therefore a material interlocutor
                for the unknown, for monsoonal breakdown to come.

                Placed in a white leaf resin of the areca palm are
                some peppercorns that my grandfather picked
                early one morning during a casual stroll around his
                farm. I had always found it interesting that he never
                spoke of pepper as something that they grew; it just
                happened to be there. Its vines made their presence
                known through their generous embrace of palm
                trees. Black pepper is native to South India and is
                intimately part of its monsoonal ecologies. Pepper
                is a life-form that flourishes in wetness, and climbs
                trees to find the sky. Some of the oldest western
                stories of monsoon winds trace back to the story
                of pepper – its trade, mobility and consumption.
                Monsoon winds bring it into conversations between
                worlds. Pepper occupies a unique interlocutory
                temporality which speaks to the history of wealth,
                culture, trade, extraction, caste, navigation and
                civilisation. Most importantly, pepper is monsoonal.
                It mobilises flavour and stories.

              <p class="copyText">
                To escape the harsh winter in Siberia, Heuglin’s
                gulls migrate to India every year where they can
                be spotted on the Yamuna and Ganga rivers. A
                much loved spot for gull watching in Delhi is on the
                ghats. Ghat is a figure of description that represents
                valleys, passages, forests and embankments. In this
                instance, ghat refers to the steps and platforms on
                the Yamuna River that are also a site of cremation.
                Monsoon rains rejuvenate the river each year,
                increasing the level of oxygen, biotic life and nutrition
                in its waters and producing a favourable environment
                for the gulls. Environmental contamination and
                anthropogenic consumption has impacted this
                annual migration. Yet the monsoon and the Yamuna
                in Delhi, even in its altered state, offer refuge to
                these birds and several other species as part of their
                annual journey south.

                The Yamuna is not only a river but also a deity.
                While scholars have debated the cultural separation
                of rivers between natural, scientific, spiritual and
                more-than-human categories, I want to stay with the
                cosmological idea of the Yamuna as the daughter
                of Surya, the sun. By storying the water of the earth
                as the daughter of the sun, truth telling and story
                telling become wildly interchangeable. My proposal
                is that some generosity and colonial detuning holds
                potential to unpack the work of categories, just
                like the Yamuna which simmers below the city and
                the city which floods the river with industry and
                anthropogenic activity. The cosmological helps to
                understand that a conversation with the Yamuna is
                not too different from the political, economic work
                of treating, contaminating, barraging, polluting,
                damning, bridging, canaling, drilling and mining it.

                A plant called <em>Prosopis juliflora</em> grows throughout
                Delhi. It was introduced by the British in the early
                twentieth century as part of a botanical experiment
                and has since spread throughout India. Its ability to
                ward off other species, thanks to its thorns and the
                enzymatic compounds in its roots, and its ability to
                tap into the deep water table has made it a much
                hated species. Unlike arid monsoon forests, which
                are intimately attuned to seasonal rhythms and
                changes, <em>Prosopis juliflora</em> is green throughout the
                year. It has become the monsoon forest in/of the
                Anthropocene, in the sense that it refuses to be
                uprooted by policy and practice. It simply grows
                back. In the process, residents, agriculturalists and
                scientists are conspiring new ways to live with, think
                with, and negotiate with it.

                Sometimes it really, really rains. For a brief moment,

                and sensorial registers that one has heard from one’s
                elders begin to make sense. Under the sheer density
                of rain, one is compelled to meditate into the sound
                not by choice but by sheer circumstance. When
                it rains in the city, urban materiality vibrates. One
                thinks of kin on the street, on the way home, going
                somewhere. It’s a weird confluence of joy and fear.
                It frames the political conversation of life for days
                to come. When it really, really rains. In an act of luck
                and serendipity, the air showered immensely just

                While geologists and writers remind us that the
                Himalayas invented the monsoon when they
                emerged eight to sixteen million years ago, in
                contemporary history the upper Himalayan Plateau
                has rarely seen rain. In recent years though, cloud
                bursts in the high altitude region of Ladakh have
                been intensifying during the monsoon, producing
                human disasters in a landscape that isn’t used to
                rain. The changing monsoon climate has also been
                influencing the northward migration of different
                species. The valleys and upper Himalayan Plateau
                are crucial spaces of change that have wide ranging
                effects on the monsoon system. Melting glaciers,
                plantations, military modernity and anthropogenic
                aerosol ecologies are playing important roles in the
                determination of monsoonal futures.

                In Mahayana and Ladakhi-Tibetan cosmology, the <em>Lung Ta</em>, or horizontal prayer flags sustain and
                expand the work of prayer and good fortune. They
                represent the five elements (Sky, Air, Water, Fire
                and Earth) through the figure of a mythical wind
                horse. They are part of an interwoven cosmological
                tradition and research practice that theorises the
                earth and existence from the position of Himalayan
                thought. Despite their seeming ubiquitousness,
                prayer flags are highly temporal objects and are
                ritually replenished, replaced, re-written and burnt, at
                one with the impermanence of the wind that enlivens
                them.

                This is Lloyds of London, one of the world’s largest
                risk marketplaces. On this same site on Leadenhall
                Street stood the East India House, the headquarters
                of the British East India Company, demolished
                in 1861. It had commissioned the first colonial
                meteorological observatory in Madras in 1791.
                Meteorological observatories played a key role in
                developing a colonial emperics of weather that
                enabled administrations to theorise life in terms of
                risk and extractive profitability. As theorists from
                London penned an understanding of the monsoon,
                notions of racialised tropicality, disease and vitality
                played confluential roles. Meteorology today is
                the basis of understanding weather futures which
                influence risk contracts and plans interested in the
                extraction of living systems for profit.
