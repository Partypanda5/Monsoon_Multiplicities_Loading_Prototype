        Three of ten major world-making rivers that rise on the Tibetan Plateau - the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra – frame the monsoon’s path, from the Indus River’s south-westward flow towards the Arabian Sea, to the eastward confluence of the Ganges and Brahmaputra as they make their way to the Bay of Bengal. Near the entry of each into the Bay, the Ganges and Brahmaputra have given rise to two of south Asia’s historic centres of culture – Kolkata and Dhaka. Each also harbours a colonial history that re-engineered the meteorological relationships of agricultural and economic landscapes, projecting both into the global financial sphere of climate speculation.

          <p class="copyText">
            As one of the first centres of colonial wealth and
            power on the Bay of Bengal, Kolkata’s riverine and
            coastal landscape offered British colonisers a unique
            opportunity to externalise local capital into emerging
            global markets. The reconstruction of Kolkata’s
            relationship to the Ganges and its tributaries via
            local and regionally scaled canal building and
            marsh reclamation projects laid the groundwork
            for a meteoro-agro-economics that recast
            monsoonal grounds as territorial indebtedness. As
            an indispensable precondition for the commodity
            economy’s conquest of South Asia’s monsoon
            driven economy, the construction of canals from
            Kolkata eastward laid the groundwork for national
            dependency on international lines of credit and
            environmental design schemes that extracted debt
            repayment by perpetuating precarity.

                monsoon away from riverine valleys and onto drier
                terrain, effectively retooling the nation’s economy.
                The project of canal building inverted the relationship

                The construction of the Ganges Canal from 1840
                onwards grew the area of India’s irrigated land and
                reduced Gangetic flows before they could reach
                Kolkata in the lower delta. With a less reliable
                relationship to the monsoonal flows of the Ganges,
                nearby farmland grew less fertile and the farmers
                more vulnerable to climate variation. As traditional
                farmers struggled, the industry of credit lending
                grew and contributed to the colonial reorientation
                of Kolkata towards the Bay of Bengal and overseas
                trade. Farmers requested lines of credit for seedsowing and crop harvesting, crafting the rise and
                fall of India’s money market around the arrival and
                departure of the monsoon.

                    Canals have always been agents of neoliberal
                    ambition, bringing the environment into marketdriven systems of policy making that capitalise
                    on the variability of earth and climate systems.
                    Securitisation, or insurance, is one of the primary
                    techniques for turning debt into tradable commodity.
                    Working in tandem with the construction of canals
                    to secure the productivity of India’s soils, the risks
                    of a volatile climate were offset with an infusion of
                    credit capital, promising increased land and power in
                    turn for any failed debt repayment. To secure against
                    market failure, the government made provisions
                    for agricultural insurance, yet, structured around
                    famine, not drought, it failed to reduce the economic
                    significance of weather

                Company turned to Dhaka, the historic city residing
                at the confluence of monsoonal rivers to the east
                of Kolkata. The ecology, urban form, and economic

                To minimise the impact of each shift, canals and

                and the international markets tied to its economy.
                It is estimated that investment in canal and

                  <p class="copyText">
                    Across monsoonal South Asia, hydrological
                    management infrastructures were constructed to
                    circumvent the inherent variability of the weather
                    through the engineered extraction of meteorological
                    materials into concrete forms of management.
                    Canal networks created a monsoonal ecology of
                    meteoro-agro-economics as central to today’s
                    global marketplace of climate finance as it was to
                    yesterday’s structuring of monsoonal agriculture.
                    By exploiting the monsoon’s indeterminacies,
                    developers, consultants, and politicians reorganise
                    the future by concentrating power and capital flows
                    in the present. Each recurring disaster generates
                    a perceived scarcity of time that expedites the
                    conditions necessary for hurried credit swaps
                    and foreign direct investment that re-inscribe neocolonial power relations. Canal projects re-designed
                    hydro-meteorological relations and monetised the
                    monsoon, laying the groundwork for the current,
                    shared crisis of climate disaster and debt.
