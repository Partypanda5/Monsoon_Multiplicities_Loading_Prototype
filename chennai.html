                  Far from being neutral backdrops
                  to one another, Chennai and the

                  and the human actions that have
                  colonised, leveraged or transformed them.

                  From the time of the early Tamil Kingdoms (300
                  BCE-300 CE), sailing communities were trading
                  around the Bay of Bengal and the Mediterranean
                  was linked with southern China by the winds of
                  the monsoon. From the early seventeenth century
                  onwards, Europeans colonised these ancient trading
                  networks and the winds that enabled them. In 1639,
                  merchants of the English East India Company (EEIC),
                  founded Madras on a sandy spit of land on the Bay
                  of Bengal granted to them by Vijayanagara <em>nayak</em>
                  Darmala Venkatapati. Here they constructed Fort
                  Saint George as the nucleus of their settlement.
                  Soon buildings and streets sprang up to the north
                  of the fort and merchants and weavers established
                  themselves.

                  People on the shores of the Ocean used

                  The Bay of Bengal is notorious for its depressions
                  and cyclones. They are the dread of navigators
                  who cross it and of the people who live on its
                  shores. Given its exposed location, Madras was
                  susceptible to these dynamics from the start and
                  destructive cyclonic storms and depressions are
                  written into its history. In November and December
                  2015, a widespread depression over the southern
                  Bay resulted in prolonged heavy rainfall over
                  Chennai, resulting in extensive flooding and loss
                  of life. Flooding was aggravated by bureaucratic
                  unpreparedness and development patterns that had
                  compromised the landscape’s capacities to retain
                  and absorb water.

                  Chennai is one of the hottest cities in India. It is
                  made habitable by sea breezes and evaporative
                  cooling from its tanks and backwaters. These
                  dynamics are reflected in the city’s layout. Early
                  Tamil settlements were organised in concentric
                  patterns around temple tanks, with higher castes
                  located closest to the tanks where they benefited
                  from convective cooling. Colonial Madras was laid
                  out in long urban blocks on the coastal spit to the
                  north of the Fort, which allowed buildings to take
                  maximum advantage of sea breezes. By the early
                  1900s, these blocks were occupied by traders and
                  lower caste groups, while Brahmins congregated
                  around traditional temple tanks or on the back, more
                  protected side of the coastal dunes. Europeans lived
                  in garden estates to the west or south of the town.
                  This pattern of aerially attuned social and spatial
                  segregation continues today

                  During Tamil Nadu’s Chola Dynasty (850-1280)
                  a tank based water management system was
                  developed to retain and redistribute northeast
                  monsoon rainfall. Today tanks, along with marshes
                  and coastal backwaters, play a significant role in
                  water management within the wider ecology of water
                  infrastructures. Tanks contribute to local ecologies,
                  drawing moisture from the air and inducing localised
                  rain showers. However, because they expand and
                  contract with the seasons, their fluctuating wetness
                  makes them targets for development, reducing
                  the water retaining capacity of the landscape.
                  Development patterns have led, not only to water
                  insecurities, but also to increased incidents of
                  flooding and water logging.

                  In the mid-eighteenth century, the English East
                  India Company produced the first colonial
                  astronomical survey in India and established a
                  permanent astronomical observatory in Madras. Its
                  Nungambakkam site served as the datum for the
                  Great Trigonometrical Survey through which the
                  British established their control over India. Today
                  meteorology and weather forecasts are firmly
                  embedded in the Chennai’s social and cultural
                  imaginary and the city’s amateur weather bloggers
                  have massive social media followings. Meteorology
                  is more than science in Chennai, it is a way of
                  thinking that entangles the air and its dynamics in

                  India’s post independence economy was centrally
                  planned and managed until the 1990s, when
                  economic reforms promoted information technology
                  (IT) as an engine of economic growth. As a result,
                  electromagnetic waves have become national
                  resources, much like water, land, gas or minerals and
                  national legislation governs competition over the
                  wave spectrum. However, humidity, air pressure, air
                  temperature, rain, rainfall rate and wind all impact
                  the quality of wave propagation. This became clear
                  when Cyclone Vardah made landfall on Chennai
                  in December 2016. It damaged a number of key
                  undersea fibre optic cables, impacting IT, banking,
                  telecommunications and social media. The cyclone
                  exposed the extent to which India’s digital economy
                  is entangled with and exposed to the inhuman
                  dynamics of the aerial monsoon and its modes of
                  world-making.

                    yielding no revenue, what does it do? Whereas

                    much construction, that will put the GDP
                    ahead, it will look cool, more people will come,

              increasing reliance on air-conditioning, Chennai’s
              energy demands escalated. Two thermal power
              plants were built at Ennore in the north of the city,
              supplied with coal through Ennore Port. The power
              stations’ emissions pollute the air with toxic particles
              that, when inhaled, enter the brain, the lungs and
              the heart, causing devastating health problems.
              This is having particularly impact on the fishing
              communities of Ennore Creek where ambient air
              pollution clusters.

              Aerial emissions are mobile and caught up in
              systems that extend way beyond urban limits. In
              November 2019, winds bore hazardous plumes
              of pollution from Punjab and Haryana all the
              way down the Coromandel Coast to Chennai. As
              pollution levels rose, forecasters searched for
              signs of depressions over the North Andaman
              Sea, which would not only generate rain for
              Chennai, but also pull the smog filled air currents
              eastwards. They were a reminder that monsoon
              air is emergent and unpredictable and exposed
              Chennai’s citizens to the eventfulness of its ways.

                    R. Pradeep John <br> <br>
                    R. Pradeep John is an independent Chennai based weather forecaster and blogger. He
                    posts on Facebook under the name ‘Tamil Nadu Weatherman,’ and has around 250,000
                    followers.<sup>10</sup> The following are extracts from his Facebook page during August 2017.
                    The posts provide accounts of when and where rain is falling at a very local scale, and
                    predictions of how this is likely to change, sometimes at hourly intervals. They combine
                    predictions, warnings, social commentary, instructions on how to interpret weather data
                    and simply a love for rain. They are a detailed source of information about monsoon
                    air, its behaviour, what influences it, how to predict its movements and what the
                    consequences are for humans when its water vapour condenses and falls as rain.
