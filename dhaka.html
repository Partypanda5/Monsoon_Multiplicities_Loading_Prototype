          Bangladesh is a fluctuating monsoonal terrain.
          It is almost half covered in water between June
          and October each year when it receives huge
          inflows of water and sediment carried from the
          Himalayas by the Ganges, Brahmaputra and
          Meghna Rivers. In addition to this, it is impacted
          by oceanic dynamics that originate in the Bay
          of Bengal such as tides, reversing currents,
          cyclones and storm surges that frequently push
          seawater many kilometres inland and shape
          coastal ecologies.

          that rises from the bed of a river…
          chars [are] hybrid environments, not
          just a mixture of land and water, but
          a uniquely fluid environment where

          called chars that cannot be mapped, legally owned
          or recorded in revenue papers because they move
          around too quickly and too frequently. Chars have
          historically been occupied by precarious, marginal
          people, often without official documents. Those who
          live on them lead perilous, calamitous lives. When the
          monsoon breaks and the flow of rivers increase each
          year, their land frequently deserts them, their shelters
          are devastated, crops are damaged and livestock
          washed away. As the river recedes, new chars emerge
          and fierce, at times violent struggles to occupy them,
          overseen by local strongmen, ensue.

          four rivers and criss-crossed by a meshwork of

          the monsoon. After independence, it expanded
          northwards along the clay tract, but, more recently
          growth has been directed westwards, protected
          by an embankment along the Buriganga River, and
          eastwards, where it has displaced agricultural

          real estate sector. It is an area of low
          floodplains and marshy lands that are
          inundated during the monsoon. To prepare
          land for development, land is elevated
          above predicted flood levels through a
          process known as sand pumping. Dredgers
          suction vast quantities of sand from river
          beds, which is then pumped from barges
          via steel pipes into the floodplains and
          marshlands. Dhaka East is being
          reimagined and reformed from the fluid
          fabric of the monsoon via the extraction
          and redistribution of sand.

          “Throughout Hindoostan, the arts
          of spinning and weaving cotton
          fabrics have been practiced from
          remote antiquity; but in no part of
          that extensive region have they
          been carried to such perfection
          as in Bengal. The muslins of this
          province were famed for their
          fineness … and are still made so
          exquisitely delicate that ‘some of
          them … might be thought the work
          of fairies, or of insects, rather than of men".<sup>5</sup><br> <br> <br>

          "The most favourable time for
          weaving the fine muslins, is during
          the rains, at which season the
          moisture in the atmosphere prevents
          the thread from breaking”.<sup>6</sup>

        <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
          Under Moghul rule, Dhaka rose from a humble
          military outpost to a burgeoning metropolis
          driven largely by the production of textiles.
          Royal workshops, with their hub in Dhaka, were
          established to supervise the manufacture of fine
          muslin cloth for the court of the Emperor. Over
          time Dhaka weavers became the most famous
          in India. Dacca muslin, known as <em>mulmul khas</em>
          or imperial cloth, gained a reputation for its
          extraordinary qualities, beauty and fineness.
          These properties were connected to the city’s
          monsoonal landscape, in which a particular
          variety of cotton, locally known as <em>photee</em>, was
          grown. Temperature and humidity, soil ecology
          and minerals within the river water imparted
          it with unique qualities. Weaving was timed in
          accordance with the humidity of the monsoon
          and the practice of placing shallow vessels of
          water beneath looms to keep the fabric moist
          gave rise to the notion that Dacca muslins were
          woven under water.

      “The Buriganga gave life to
      Dhaka and Dhaka killed it”.<sup>7</sup><br> <br> <br>

      “The pollution of the rivers is
      heart breaking, I can’t bear to
      stand and suffer it. It’s illegal…
      There’s no way you should use
      chemicals and run it into the
      rivers, no way! But that’s what
      happens and they’re millionaires.
      The garment industry are the
      richest people because they cut
      corners all the time”.<sup>8</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
      Following independence in 1971, Bangladesh set
      in place neoliberal policies that saw an exponential
      growth in the garment industry. Like the Moghul textile
      industry had been, the hub of this industry is Dhaka, but
      unlike it, it supplies cheap clothes to the global market.
      The modern industry is predicated on the exploitation
      of cheap labour and what Jason Moore called “cheap
      nature”.<sup>9</sup>
       Garment production is dependent on water for
      all steps of manufacturing, from washing and dyeing to
      textile finishing. Most of the water is sourced from the
      Dupi Tila aquifer, which is being depleted by millions
      of cubic metres of water each year. The industry
      also disposes large quantities of contaminated
      wastewater into Dhaka’s interlinked rivers and canals.
      This has meant that many of Dhaka’s rivers have been
      pronounced biologically dead, with implications for life
      and livelihoods downstream.

    The timeline of the rise of the garment sector in

    there were 250 and there are now more than 1,500

    two sectors are embodied in powerful diversified
    business groups that consist of textile and spinning
    mills, dredging companies, cement and steel
    manufacturers and property development. These
    clusters use their power and political connections
    to pull strings and acquire land and capital. Such

  Arcadia Education Project, South Kanarchor.<br> <br>
  Architect: Saif Ul Haque, 2016. <br> <br>
  On October 14, 2011, I was taken to see a site for a
  prospective project for a preschool on the outskirts of
  Dhaka city. After an hour’s drive from the city, the site
  was pointed out to me. To my surprise, I could not see
  any land; rather what I saw was a flooded river bank.
  I exclaimed “I don’t see any land!” This, of course, is
  a typical reaction of an architect who would expect
  to see a piece of land for a prospective project, not
  water. I was then assured land would emerge within a
  couple of weeks.<sup>11</sup>

  Jol O Jongoler Kabbo, meaning ‘the rhythm of water
  and forest’ is a weekend retreat designed by landscape
  architect Khondaker Hasibul Kabir in Pubail, Bangladesh.
  Its architecture is constructed as part of a social
  waterscape and encourages multi-sensory engagement.
  The resort conserves wetlands and a patch of forest and
  employs the neighbouring community in management and
  maintenance. The retreat is a counterpoint to the traumatic
  transformation of the landscape taking place around it in
  the name of industrialisation and development.
