              Year after year, as they sweep across the Indian
              terrain, the southwest and northeast monsoons act
              as architects of seasonal change. Like the monsoon
              itself, these changes are both material and social.
              A project of extremes, monsoonal heat and rain
              produce matter, labour, exploitation and resistance.
              Salt, one of monsoonal India’s oldest and most
              reliable resources, is one such material and social
              practice. Whether found in a geologic deposit or
              harvested as a seasonal fruit of the monsoonal sun,
              the need for salt, an indispensable ingredient of life,
              gave rise to colonial conquest and heralded the call
              to battle for independence.

    Salt, a monsoonal material
  </h1>

  <p class="copyText">
    The seasonal passage of the southwest and
    northeast monsoons determines both the timeline
    and the bounty of India’s salt economy as it splits
    the arc of the sun’s annual march between the east
    and west coasts of the subcontinent. Tuned to the
    rhythms of the monsoons, the extraction of salt is
    aided by dry monsoon winds and their magnification
    by the pre- and post-monsoon sun. Today, India
    produces the third largest amount of salt in the
    world, an exponential growth since Independence in
    1947.

Exploiting salt
</h1>

<p class="copyText">
In the wake of victory at the Battle of Plassey in
1757, the English East Indian Company (EEIC)
gained control of the salt works near Kolkata. Two
years later they imposed the first official Salt Tax
on the works, doubling land rent and levying a
transport tax on manufacturers and traders. After
the Indian Rebellion a century later, the British Indian
Government formalised the legal and physical
infrastructures of salt management initiated by the
EEIC with passing of the Salt Act of 1882.

The government monopoly of India’s salt trade was
institutionalised by the construction of official salt
depots and monitored transportation routes that
impeded the rise of rogue producers and distributors.
To reduce occurrence of illegal salt production and
smuggling between districts, the British constructed
an Inland Customs Line, otherwise known as the
Great Hedge of India, which extended 2,500 miles
from the north of Punjab to the western boundary of
Orissa, effectively segregating the salt production of
the southwest monsoon from that of the northeast.

In solidarity with the winds

<p class="copyText">
Barring a brief period from 1694 to 1825, the
British public viewed salt taxation as a violation
of human rights and unfairly levied against low-income populations. Yet, according to the Salt Tax,
it was illegal for anyone who was not an authorised
British national to collect and produce salt in India.
In 1930 Mahatma Gandhi led a small band of Indian
nationals from his hometown Ahmedabad to the
coastal village of Dandi. Upon reaching the sea,
he reached down and scooped a handful of salt
from the sand. This was a direct violation of British
Law in India and an act that stoked the fires of
Independence.

Gandhi’s Salt March was not only an act of
resistance, but an experiment with the materiality
of the monsoon. His act was material and social
at once, like the monsoon itself. It led to the
abolishment of the Salt Tax in October 1946. Without
maintenance, the Great Hedge faded into the desert
and the winter and summer monsoon salt harvests
were joined once again.
