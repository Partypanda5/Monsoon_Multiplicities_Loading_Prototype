                “Just as Deleuze and Guattari ventured that all
                history is geohistory, so too can we add that all social
                formations are geosocial formations and that all life is
                geologic life”.¹ <br> <br>
                Here we explore Myanmar through the idea of the
                geological monsoon. This idea suggests the collapse
                of distinctions between the substance and agency of
                the subterranean earth and the substance and agency
                of the atmosphere, or rather of the co-constitution of
                one by the other. We propose that socio-political life in
                Myanmar has been closely bound up with the mutual
                intra-actions between geology and the monsoon over
                the course of its history.

                  Myanmar is one of the most tectonically active
                  regions on earth and lies between two interlinked
                  monsoonal systems. It originated as part of ancient
                  supercontinent Gondwana millions of years ago,
                  when tectonic slivers and later the Indian plate broke
                  off and edged slowly northwards. These plates
                  eventually collided with Eurasia, forming Indochina
                  and the Himalayas and rotating Southeast Asia
                  through 70o. This movement set up enormous
                  shearing stresses along the Sagaing Fault that
                  continue today. At the centre of Myanmar in the
                  rain shadows of the Arakan Yoma to the west and
                  the Shan Plateau to the east, both formed by this
                  tectonic history, lies the Dry Zone that was the centre
                  of power for much of Myanmar’s history

                  Myanmar’s earliest known urban cultures built walled
                  cities in the Dry Zone and on the Gulf of Martaban.
                  Pagan, a brick-walled city on the banks of the
                  Ayeyarwady River, became the capital of the Pagan
                  Dynasty, one of the great kingdoms of Southeast
                  Asia. It was at its zenith during the Medieval Climate
                  Anomaly (900-1300 CE) when the Inter Tropical
                  Convergence Zone (ITCZ) lay along a northerly
                  latitude and long La Niña conditions prevailed.
                  Strong monsoons and high rainfall in Southeast
                  Asia spurred agricultural production and brought
                  wealth and political stability. When the ITCZ shifted
                  southwards, monsoons weakened and prolonged
                  droughts and famine followed. This put Pagan under
                  severe ecological and political strain and competing
                  centres of power emerged in the Dry Zone and Lower
                  Myanmar.

                  In 1755, King Alaungpaya of the Dry Zone Konbaung
                  Dynasty conquered the cities of Lower Myanmar and
                  laid out a new settlement at Dagon at the base of the
                  Shwedagon Pagoda. It soon grew into a flourishing
                  port. In 1824 it was the target of British assault
                  during the first Anglo-Burmese War, and again in the
                  second in 1852 when it was completely destroyed.
                  On the site of Alaungpaya’s Dagon, the British built
                  a new city they called Rangoon. During colonial rule
                  (1852-1947), it was the commercial, financial and
                  administrative capital of British Burma and, for a
                  time, one of the busiest port cities in Asia.

                  British interests in Burma focused on the extraction
                  of the country’s geomonsoonal resources.
                  Teak was logged for shipbuilding and railway
                  construction and Burma became the biggest
                  exporter of rice in the world. In 1889 the Glasgow based Rangoon Oil Company sunk wells at
                  Yenangyaung in the Dry Zone, becoming the British
                  Empire’s most important source of oil until Burmah
                  Oil purchased concessions in Iran in 1905. Colonial
                  companies were floated to mine silver and lead at
                  the Namtu-Baldwin mining complex in Shan State,
                  tungsten at Mawchi in Kayah State and Myanmar’s
                  famous rubies at Mogok. Jade was of no interest
                  to the British, but it seized control of the jade mines
                  in Kachin State in 1885 and set up regulations to
                  control them.

                  Spectacularly rich deposits of jade are found
                  in Myanmar in Kachin State. After Myanmar’s
                  independence in 1947 they fell under the control of
                  the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and fuelled
                  the hopes of struggles for Kachin independence.
                  Ceasefire arrangements in the 1990s transferred the
                  deposits into the control of Myanmar’s military junta.
                  Military-owned conglomerates and private businesses
                  close to the ruling elite came to dominate the jade
                  economy, replacing artisanal mining with industrial
                  scale operations that radically altered the environment
                  and produced astounding levels of wealth. Jade
                  mining is seasonal as mines cannot be worked during
                  monsoon months. However unregistered jade diggers
                  known as <em>yemase</em> (meaning ‘unwashed stones’) eke
                  out a dangerous living mining the tailings created by
                  industrialised mining operations.

                  China is the main market for Myanmar’s jade and
                  there are extensive trading networks for the stone
                  between Myanmar and China. While high quality jade
                  is sold at the official gem emporium in Naypyidaw,
                  lower grade stones are sold at jade markets in
                  Mandalay and Yangon. The biggest of these is the
                  Mahar Aung Myay market in Mandalay, which hosts
                  up to 40,000 buyers and sellers daily, although trade
                  slows during the monsoon months. From here jade is
                  legally and illegally dissolved into Chinese markets,
                  facilitated by a network of agents, infrastructures
                  and material and digital flows. The primary routes
                  are through Ruili via Muse the capital of Shan State,
                  or through a number of small towns along the
                  Chinese border via Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin
                  State.

                  From the mid 1990s onwards, Yangon experienced
                  a construction boom. While jade was transported
                  across the border into China, much of the wealth
                  it generated flowed into infrastructure and real
                  estate in Yangon. Unsurprisingly, many of Yangon’s
                  shopping malls, banks, hotels and other real estate
                  ventures are owned by the same individuals who
                  exploit Myanmar’s jade resources. It is an open
                  secret that jade mining has provided the seed capital
                  for banks, businesses and real estate development in
                  Yangon, folding geo-monsoonal wealth into the city’s
                  glittering new edifices and opulent interiors.

                  Accelerated development of Yangon after 2010
                  put enormous strain on the city’s infrastructure
                  and raised concerns about its deteriorating urban
                  environment. In 2018 the regional government
                  launched a project to develop a large tract of
                  agricultural land west of central Yangon into an
                  urban industrial district that will eventually extend
                  south to the Gulf of Martaban. The infrastructural
                  contracts for this development were awarded to
                  a Chinese state owned company. New Yangon, as
                  it is called, is the southernmost node of a forked
                  China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, linking Yangon
                  to a 2,380 km oil and gas pipeline from Myanmar’s
                  Rakhine State to China’s inland megacity, Chongqing.
                  Thus Myanmar’s geomonsoonal resources are being
                  tied ever closer to Chinese markets and agendas.
