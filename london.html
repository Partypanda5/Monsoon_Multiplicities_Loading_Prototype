          Researching the monsoon <br> from London

        <p class="smallerTextWidth copyText">
          London is the city from where colonial authority
          and racialised discourse were projected across
          monsoonal life-worlds; where colonial science
          developed empirics that cast monsoonal
          temporalities as risk and radically reorganised
          monsoonal territories for profit; where the legacies
          of colonialism are still palpable – in the India Office
          Records in the British Library, in the edifices of
          empire on Exhibition Road, in the Maritime Museum
          in Greenwich and the Palm House in Kew Gardens,
          in the city’s cuisine, in the clothes that we wear,
          in financialised commodity markets, in the rise of
          India’s elites to positions of power in British politics,
          in the impoverished South Asian communities living
          across London’s boroughs. And, not to forget, Brexit
          too is a monsoonal affair. What does it mean to
          research the monsoon from the nerve centre of this
          ongoing, racialised, colonial project?
